/*
 * MAC (for Maintaining Arc Consistency (MAC))
 * After a variable Xi is assigned a value, the INFERENCE procedure calls AC-3,
 * but instead of a queue of all arcs in the CSP, we start with only the arcs (Xj,Xi) for all
 * Xj that are unassigned variables that are neighbors of Xi. From there, AC-3 does constraint
 * propagation in the usual way, and if any variable has its domain reduced to the empty set, the
 * call to AC-3 fails and we know to backtrack immediately. We can see that MAC is strictly
 * more powerful than forward checking because forward checking does the same thing as MAC
 * on the initial arcs in MACâ€™s queue; but unlike MAC, forward checking does not recursively
 * propagate constraints when changes are made to the domains of variables.
